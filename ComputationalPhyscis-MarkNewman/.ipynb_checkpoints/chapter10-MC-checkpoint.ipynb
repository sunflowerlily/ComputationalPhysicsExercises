    " This exercise builds upon Exercise 10.3 on page 457.  If you have\n",

    "In this exercise you will develop a computer program to reproduce one of\n",

    "the one we'll study is as follows.  You take a square grid with a single\n",
    "particle in the middle.  The particle performs a random walk from square to\n",
    "square on the grid until it reaches a point on the edge of the system, at\n",
    "which point it ``sticks'' to the edge, becoming anchored there and\n",
    "immovable:\n",
    "\\medskip\n",
    "\\begin{center}\n",
    "\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{dla.eps}\n",
    "\\end{center}\n",
    "Then a second particle starts at the center and does a random walk until it\n",
    "sticks either to an edge or to the other particle.  Then a third particle\n",
    "starts, and so on.  Each particle starts at the center and walks until it\n",
    "sticks either to an edge or to any anchored particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a copy of the Brownian motion program that you wrote for\n",
    "  Exercise 10.3.  This will serve as a starting point for your DLA program.\n",
    "  Modify your program to perform the DLA process on a $101\\times101$\n",
    "  lattice---we choose an odd length for the side of the square so that\n",
    "  there is one lattice site exactly in the center.  Repeatedly introduce a\n",
    "  new particle at the center and have it walk randomly until it sticks to\n",
    "  an edge or an anchored particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You will need to decide some things.  How are you going to store the\n",
    "  positions of the anchored particles?  On each step of the random walk you\n",
    "  will have to check the particle's neighboring squares to see if they are\n",
    "  outside the edge of the system or are occupied by an anchored particle.\n",
    "  How are you going to do this?  You should also modify your visualization\n",
    "  code from the Brownian motion exercise to visualize the positions of both\n",
    "  the randomly walking particles and the anchored particles.  Run your\n",
    "  program for a while and observe what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the interests of speed, change your program so that it shows only\n",
    "  the anchored particles on the screen and not the randomly walking ones.\n",
    "  That way you need update the pictures on the screen only when a new\n",
    "  particle becomes anchored.  Also remove any \\verb|rate| statements that\n",
    "  you added to make the animation smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Set up the program so that it stops running once there is an anchored\n",
    "  particle in the center of the grid, at the point where each particle\n",
    "  starts its random walk.  Once there is a particle at this point, there's\n",
    "  no point running any longer because any further particles added will be\n",
    "  anchored the moment they start out.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Run your program and see what it produces.  If you are feeling patient,\n",
    "  try modifying it to use a $201\\times201$ lattice and run it again---the\n",
    "  pictures will be more impressive, but you'll have to wait longer to\n",
    "  generate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A nice further twist is to modify the program so that the anchored\n",
    "  particles are shown in different shades or colors depending on their age,\n",
    "  with the shades or colors changing gradually from the first particle\n",
    "  added to the last.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are feeling particularly ambitious, try the following.  The\n",
    "  original version of DLA was a bit different from the version above---and\n",
    "  more difficult to do.  In the original version you start off with a\n",
    "  single \\emph{anchored} particle at the center of the grid and a new\n",
    "  particle starts from a random point on the perimeter and walks until it\n",
    "  sticks to the particle in the middle.  Then the next particle starts from\n",
    "  the perimeter and walks until it sticks to one of the other two, and so\n",
    "  on.  Particles no longer stick to the walls, but they are not allowed to\n",
    "  walk off the edge of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Unfortunately, simulating this version of DLA directly takes\n",
    "  forever---the single anchored particle in the middle of the grid is\n",
    "  difficult for a random walker to find, so you have to wait a long time\n",
    "  even for just one particle to finish its random walk.  But you can speed\n",
    "  it up using a clever trick: when the randomly walking particle does\n",
    "  finally find its way to the center, it will cross any circle around the\n",
    "  center at a random point---no point on the circle is special so the\n",
    "  particle will just cross anywhere.  But in that case we need not wait the\n",
    "  long time required for the particle to make its way to the center and\n",
    "  cross that circle.  We can just cut to the chase and start the particle\n",
    "  on the circle at a random point, rather than at the boundary of the grid.\n",
    "  Thus the procedure for simulating this version of DLA is as follows:\n",
    "{\\renewcommand{\\labelenumii}{\\roman{enumii})\\ }\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a single anchored particle in the middle of the grid.\n",
    "  Define a variable $r$ to record the furthest distance of any anchored\n",
    "  particle from the center of the grid.  Initially $r=0$.\n",
    "1. For each additional particle, start the particle at a random point\n",
    "  around a circle centered on the center of the grid and having radius\n",
    "  $r+1$.  You may not be able to start exactly on the circle, if the chosen\n",
    "  random point doesn't fall precisely on a grid point, in which case start\n",
    "  on the nearest grid point outside the circle.\n",
    "1. Perform a random walk until the particle sticks to another one,\n",
    "  except that if the particle ever gets more than $2r$ away from the\n",
    "  center, throw it away and start a new particle at a random point on the\n",
    "  circle again.\n",
    "1. Every time a particle sticks, calculate its distance from the center\n",
    "  and if that distance is greater than the current value of $r$, update $r$\n",
    "  to the new value.\n",
    "1. The program stops running once $r$ surpasses a half of the distance\n",
    "  from the center of the grid to the boundary, to prevent particles from\n",
    "  ever walking outside the grid.\n",
    "}\n",
    "Try running your program with a $101\\times101$ grid initially and see what\n",
    "you get."

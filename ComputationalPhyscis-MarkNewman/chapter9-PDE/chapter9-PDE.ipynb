    "  for the electric potential changes by less than $10^{-6}\\,$V per step at\n",
    "  every grid point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 9.2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Gauss--Seidel method to solve Laplace's equation for\n",
    "  the two-dimensional problem in Example 9.1---a square box $1\\,$m on each\n",
    "  side, at voltage $V=1$ volt along the top wall and zero volts along the\n",
    "  other three.  Use a grid of spacing $a=1\\,$cm, so that there are 100 grid\n",

    "  find which value gives the fastest solution.  As mentioned above, you\n",
    "  should find that a value around 0.9 does well.  In general larger values\n",
    "  cause the calculation to run faster, but if you choose too large a value\n",
    "  the speed drops off and for values above 1 the calculation becomes\n",
    "  unstable.\n",

    "### Exercise 9.3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following simple model of an electronic capacitor,\n",

    "Hint: Notice that the capacitor plates are at fixed \\emph{voltage}, not\n",
    "fixed charge, so this problem differs from the problem with the two charges\n",
    "in Exercise 9.1.  In effect, the capacitor plates are part of the boundary\n",

    "### Exercise 9.5 \n",
    "\n",
    "**FTCS solution of the wave equation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a piano string of\n",
    "length $L$, initially at rest.  At time $t=0$ the string is struck by the\n",
    "piano hammer a distance $d$ from the end of the string:\n",
    "<img src=\"piano.png\">\n",
    "The string vibrates as a result of being struck, except at\n",
    "the ends, $x=0$ and $x=L$, where it is held fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a program that uses the FTCS method to solve the complete set\n",
    "  of simultaneous first-order equations, Eq. (9.28), for the case\n",
    "  $v=100\\,\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, with the initial condition that $\\phi(x)=0$\n",

    "1. Make an animation of the motion of the piano string using the\n",
    "  facilities provided by the \\verb|visual| package, which we studied in\n",
    "  Section 3.4.  There are various ways you could do this.  A simple one\n",
    "  would be to just place a small sphere at the location of each grid point\n",
    "  on the string.  A more sophisticated approach would be to use the\n",
    "  \\verb|curve| object in the \\verb|visual| package---see the on-line\n",
    "  documentation at \\texttt{www.vpython.org} for details.  A convenient\n",
    "  feature of the curve object is that you can specify its set of $x$\n",
    "  positions and $y$ positions separately as arrays.  In this exercise the\n",
    "  $x$ positions only need to specified once, since they never change, while\n",
    "  the $y$ positions will need to be specified anew each time you take a\n",
    "  time-step.  Also, since the vertical displacement of the string is much\n",
    "  less than its horizontal length, you will probably need to multiply the\n",
    "  vertical displacement by a fairly large factor to make it visible on the\n",
    "  screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Allow your animation to run for some time, until numerical instabilities\n",

    "### Exercise 9.7 \n",
    "\n",
    "**The relaxation method for ordinary differential\n",
    "  equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no reason why the relaxation method must be restricted to\n",
    "the solution of differential equations with two or more independent\n",
    "variables.  It can also be applied to those with one independent variable,\n",
    "i.e., to ordinary differential equations.  In this context, as with partial\n",
    "differential equations, it is a technique for solving boundary value\n",
    "problems, which are less common with ordinary differential equations but do\n",
    "occur---we discussed them in Section 8.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the problem we looked at in Example 8.8 on page 390, in which a\n",
    "ball of mass $m=1\\,$kg is thrown from height $x=0$ into the air and lands\n",
    "back at $x=0$ ten seconds later.  The problem is to calculate the\n",
    "trajectory of the ball, but we cannot do it using initial value methods\n",
    "like the ordinary Runge--Kutta method because we are not told the initial\n",
    "velocity of the ball.  One approach to finding a solution is the shooting\n",
    "method of Section 8.6.1.  Another is the relaxation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring friction effects, the trajectory is the solution of the ordinary\n",
    "differential equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\dd^2 x\\over\\dd t^2} = -g,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replacing the second derivative in this equation with its\n",
    "  finite-difference approximation, Eq. (5.109), derive a relaxation-method\n",
    "  equation for solving this problem on a time-like ``grid'' of points with\n",
    "  separation $h$.\n",
    "1. Taking the boundary conditions to be that $x=0$ at $t=0$ and $t=10$,\n",
    "  write a program to solve for the height of the ball as a function of time\n",
    "  using the relaxation method with 100 points and make a plot of the result\n",
    "  from $t=0$ to $t=10$.  Run the relaxation method until the answers change\n",
    "  by $10^{-6}$ or less at every point on each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, unlike the shooting method, the relaxation method does not give\n",
    "us the initial value of the velocity needed to achieve the required\n",
    "solution.  It gives us only the solution itself, although one could get an\n",
    "approximation to the initial velocity by calculating a numerical derivative\n",
    "of the solution at time $t=0$.  On balance, however, the relaxation method\n",
    "for ordinary differential equations is most useful when one wants to know\n",
    "the details of the solution itself, but not the initial conditions needed\n",
    "to achieve it.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Schr&ouml;dinger equation and the Crank--Nicolson\n",
    "  method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important partial differential equation, at least\n",
    "for physicists, is the Schr&ouml;dinger equation.  This exercise uses the\n",
    "Crank--Nicolson method to solve the full time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger\n",
    "equation and hence develop a picture of how a wavefunction evolves over\n",
    "time.  The following exercise, Exercise 9.9, solves the same problem again,\n",
    "but using the spectral method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in one dimension.  The\n",
    "techniques for calculating solutions in two or three dimensions are\n",
    "basically the same as for one dimension, but the calculations take much\n",
    "longer on the computer, so in the interests of speed we'll stick with one\n",
    "dimension.  In one dimension the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a particle of\n",
    "mass $M$ with no potential energy reads\n",
